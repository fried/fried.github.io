I don't intend to start a blog but I do intend to write. I've been writing sci-fi/fantasy stories for many years now. I started out writing stories for roleplaying games. Many of those games never got run, or died due to scheduling issues of players or me the DM/GM.  I think one I have been working on for many years would make a great novel, but I don't know if I can actually write a novel.  So I'm going to release a web novel or at least try too.
